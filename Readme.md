Archive.org eTree Downloader
============================

Very quick tool so I can quickly convert eTree concert recordings from 
Archive.org to MP3. Renames and tags them based on the meta data on archive.org.

It uses ffmpeg to do the conversion of Flac and SHN to MP3.

## Usage

     ArchiveOrgDownloader.exe <destinationfolder> <archive.org address>
	 
### Example:
     ArchiveOrgDownloader.exe E:\MP3\Concerts https://archive.org/details/frames2007-09-05.mix.flac16

Future Plans
============
Not many, it does what I need.
 - Code cleanup
 - Lossless option (eg conversion of shn to flac)
